## [Enterprise Components for kdb+](tutorial)

![Overview](../master/doc/img/Slide1.PNG)

### Objective
Enterprise Components have been designed with the goal to provide core functionality to kdb+ installations:
- complying with well-known IT policies for enterprise infrastructures
- keeping the performance and flexibility of kdb+
- making kdb+ development easier as well as faster and infrastructures more robust
- ensuring efficient operations of kdb+ infrastructures

In order to achieve these goals Exxeleron’s solutions follow best practices for robust and efficient IT service delivery and system architecture. Enterprise Components’ development is guided by overall TCO (total cost of ownership) considerations where special attention is given to: 
- System Vision - new infrastructure should fit naturally into the architectural blueprint, 
ensuring long-term return on investment 
- Flexibility and Low Coupling - avoiding dependencies and complexity where possible 
- Reuse and Modularity - profiting from investments within their respective core capabilities 
- Flexibility - adaptation to changing business needs should be possible with small investments
- Service Orientation - low TCO and well behaved integration functionality silos 
- Low Maintenance - robustness and automation built-in 

Customers building their kdb+ architectures with Enterprise Components benefit from:
- reduced time-to-market cycles due to the wide set of supported features available out-of-the-box
- efficiently managed operational risks due to proven kdb+ design principles
- simpler architectures due to consistent system design and system operations
- motivated kdb+ teams focusing on core business requirements rather than basic infrastructure functionality

### Key features
Enterprise Components provide an optimized set of building blocks that can get quickly assembled into complex kdb+ deployments. 

![Overview](../master/doc/img/Slide3.PNG)

Building blocks are based on common foundation - set of libraries built on top of q. The libraries are unifying and facilitating usage of various q resources. New building blocks can be easily created by using these libraries which enable development process and allow natural integration with the rest of the system.

Enterprise Components enable management of the data flow at all levels, starting from high-frequency data capture and stream distribution through on-stream, in-memory, and on-disk data analysis to interface components for applications and programming languages.

Enterprise Components’ functionality is driven by real-life needs. It combines DEVnet experience with modular kdb+ installations that harness kdb+’s full power and flexibility.
